# Repository II: The Awakening  

This is my second school repository. It contains some of the best code known to man, and simply showing somebody this will instantly land me a job at any programming-based company. 

## Notable Scripts
*** 
- A very bare-bones 3D rendering engine
- A Chrome Dino copy that can play itself
- A script containing really useful helper functions
- A wonderfully written README

## Future Projects
***
- My own programming language for pygame
- ROUGELIKE
- A simple infinite runner game using the 3D renderer
- An update to Flesh Cube II that adds sprites and powerups
- Get to Canada imported into this repository
