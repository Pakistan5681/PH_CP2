# Repository II: The Awakening  

This is my second school repository. It contains some of the best code known to man, and simply showing somebody this will instantly land me a job at any programming-based company. 
 
## Notable Scripts
*** 
- A very bare-bones 3D rendering engine
- A Chrome Dino copy that can play itself
- A script containing really useful helper functions
- A wonderfully written README

## Future Projects
***
1. My own programming language for pygame
2. A simple infinite runner game using the 3D renderer
3. An update to Flesh Cube II that adds sprites and powerups
4. Get to Canada imported into this repository
